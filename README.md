# Guess my Number


A random number guessing game where the app randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess the number. The player gets feedback for each guess – “hot” if their guess was close, and “cold” if their guess was far. When the user guesses the secret number, the app lets them know, and they’ll have the option to start a new game.

This app is built with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.
